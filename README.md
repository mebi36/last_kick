The app analyses some football data in Python (Pandas) and Rust (Polars-rs). The odds of a football game having a single goal are typically very high (typically 99/100). Here we test the hypothesis that football games with no goals in the first 75 minutes will still have a goal in the last 15 minutes. The idea is that players will become more susceptible to mistakes in the final part of the game due to the sustained effort it has taken to get to that part of the match.

Some football data was collected across 3 competitions over a 1-year period to build the analysis logic, but more data will definitely give more credence to the insights derived from the analysis.
