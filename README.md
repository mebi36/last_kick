The app analyzes some football data in Python (Pandas) and Rust (Polars-rs). The odds of a football game having a single goal is typically very high (typically 99/100). Here we test the hypothesis that football game with no goals will have a goal in the last 15 minutes. The idea is that players will become more more susceptible to mistakes in the final part of the game due to the sustained effort it has taken to get to that part of the match.

Some football data was collected across 3 competitions, over a 1 year period for building the analysis logic but more will data will definitely give more credance to the insights derived from the analysis.
